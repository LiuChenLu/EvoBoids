Evolutionary Boids
=====================================================================

ABOUT

Boids are either a species of boa snake or a simulated flocking
organism that mimics birds. Though programming a real boa snake would
be lots of fun, this project predominately deals with Boids as
defined by the second definition.

Members of the initial Boids population has randomized traits in
affinity, separation, and cohesion. These are the Boid's flocking 
parameters (explained below). Each Boid must find food in order to 
survive. If a Boid does not find food after 100 iterations, it will
starve to death and be removed from the genetic pool. 

When the total Boid population drops to a critical low point, 
remaining Boids will reproduce. Each Boid has the same chance of 
reproducing with any other Boid and produce a child that is the 
(randomly) weighted average of the parents' traits. 

After several evolutionary cycles (usually about 5), all Boids will 
look very similar! Almost always a population with low-ish cohesion, 
high separation and low-ish alignment is selected for.

Try changing some parameters in the code and see what population is
selected for in your enviroment!

Boids logic

-the circles around each Boid represent its traits. More vivid the 
 ring, the more heavily the trait is favoured
 -inner-most (red) circle represents cohesion.
  A Boid with high cohesion will really want to fly towards the
  centroid of nearby flocks.
 -middle circle (green) represent separation.
  A Boid with high separation prefers to keep its personal space from
  other Boids.
 -the outter circle represent alignment
  A boid with high alignment want to fly in the same direction as its
  neighbours
-hungry boids will move slower in general
-hungry boids are more motivated to move towards food
-flocking is rewarded by:
 -all Boids have a non zero chance of not noticing food
 -food tends to appear in clusters
